## 🧠 Featured Projects

### 🔹 **Smart DB**
LLM-integrated database agent system that queries database tables from natural language requests.  
Transforms English queries → internal agentic workflow → optimized DB execution.

### 🔹 **Doc QA (RAG-based Document Assistant)**
Built using **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex** to enable efficient, semantic retrieval and question answering over PDF/text datasets.

### 🔹 **Document AI (Multi-modal)**
Achieved:
- **98% accuracy** in document classification  
- **95% accuracy** in entity extraction  
- Added multilingual translation & OCR support using transformer models
